== Description ==

Watcher is a development plugin designed for WordPress projects using Bedrock or WordPlate. It allows developers to monitor and synchronize files between external development directories and WordPress plugin and theme directories.

This plugin is particularly useful for developers working with Composer-managed environments, ensuring that custom development remains outside the WordPress installation while still being synchronized automatically.
